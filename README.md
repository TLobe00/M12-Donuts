# Coding Interview (Pair Programming Exercise)

## Mile12 Donuts 

### Preparation 
Prior to your Coding Interview, please be sure you pull down this repo and have the application running locally. This means your local database should be created and any migrations and seeders should be ran.  

### What we will be building 
During this pair programming session we will be working towards implementing a mock checkout feature. Users should be able to select their desired donut, fill out their information and "checkout", completing their order. Upon successful completion of the orders, users should be taken to a confirmation screen with details about their order.
